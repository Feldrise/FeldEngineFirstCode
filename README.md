# FeldEngineFirstCode
This is FeldEngine! So, why "FirstCode"? 
You probably already know, we want to create a game engine with different module. But, for now, we can't define where will go some function, what module depend on what module...
So, for now we are creating a unique core module, before creating others modules.
